    This one is a real gem. It's a passion project created by one guy,
    it has its own interpreter and compiler, and even its own standard library
    which <b>includes</b> a graphics API. Wild.

    Ceylon was a language written for the JVM that had a lot going for it, but
    it could not compete with Kotlin and Groovy. It's one of the only languages
    I'm aware of that introduces the concept of <i>union</i> and <i>intersection</i>
    types. It really took the idea of advancing Java and adding in more functional
    elements and tried running with it. \
    Unfortunately, it fell through and is now completely deprecated.

    This is my language I'm currently working on. Planning on having it be a
    bytecode compiler for a stack-based virtual machine (since that's never
    been done before, right?). I plan to take my favorite elements from all
    the languages I've worked with, and add some nice syntactic sugar
    to make this a fun language to work with. Someday...
